// Package plist implements encoding and decoding of Apple's "property list" format.
// Property lists come in three sorts: plain text, XML and binary.
// Plain text (OpenStep) property lists are not currently supported by plist.
// The mapping between property list and Go objects is described in the documentation for the Encode and Decode functions.
